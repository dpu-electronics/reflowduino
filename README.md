Case and code for using Reflowduino

The original Reflowduino Github page is https://github.com/botletics/Reflowduino .  Their README has links to their wiki and webstore.

The purpuse of the case is to make sure that the bottom does not short, no wires fall into the top, and that the reflowduino doesn't break from being moved around on a table with heavy equipment.  

Case design is written in OpenScad available at www.openscad.net or better to be downloaded from www.openscad.org and run locally.  The case is a work in progress; the holes are not in the correct location yet.  Note the use of a function for No. 4-40 hex socket head bolts.

The code (from JG) is very similar to the original Reflowduino code, but has had some difficult to use features removed such as bluetooth communications and audio beeps and the associated libraries.
